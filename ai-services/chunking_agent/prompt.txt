You are a document analysis agent.

Given the following text, split it into **semantic sections**.

Each section must be returned as a JSON object with:
- "section_title": string
- "content": string
- "tags": array of lowercase strings

Return the result as a **valid JSON array only**, no explanation. 
You must escape any quotes inside text values using a backslash (e.g., " becomes \").
Do not use Markdown or formatting, only return pure JSON.

If the output is too long, return only the first 30 sections and append "PARTIAL_OUTPUT" (as a string after the JSON array).
Ensure that the JSON array is well-formed and closed even if it's partial.

Here is the text:
{{text}}
