I’ve recently implemented a **strict bedtime routine** , making a point of **turning in** before 11 p.m. Before making this change, I often stayed up well past midnight, either catching up on emails or scrolling through social media. However, I realized this habit was **taking a toll on** my energy levels and mood.

Nowadays, I **wind down** by 10:30 p.m., **eliminating late-night distractions** and **cutting back on** screen time. Instead, I might **unwind with** a book or **listen to** music. If I have a heavy workload, I still **stick to** turning off the lights by midnight at the very latest.

I believe this is a positive change because getting adequate sleep is essential for both mental and physical well-being. I’ve noticed that my brain feels more alert in the morning, and I can concentrate better on my work. My physical stamina has also improved: I’m more energetic throughout the day and have more motivation to exercise regularly. On top of that, my mood has become significantly more optimistic. I feel less irritable and stressed out.

Overall, **sticking to** this **earlier bedtime** has had a **remarkable impact** on my day-to-day life. I feel more **alert** , **productive** , and **balanced** . I’m absolutely determined to **keep up** this new routine.

**Describe something that you can’t live without (not a computer/phone)**

There are many essential items in my daily life, but one thing I truly cannot live without is my **water bottle.**

**I bought this bottle three years ago from a supermarket, and it has been with me ever since. My water bottle is from the brand Lafonte, and it has a 700ml capacity, which is the perfect size to hold a good amount of water. It is made of high-quality stainless steel, which helps keep my drinks hot or cold for hours.  Another feature I love is that it is leak-proof, so I can toss it into my bag without worrying about spills.**

There are several reasons why this water bottle is such an essential part of my life. Firstly, it **keeps me healthy** ,as I can form my habit to not buy sugary drinks anymore. Secondly, it **saves me money and reduces plastic waste** , since I don’t have to buy disposable bottles. Lastly, it has become a **comforting habit** —whenever I feel anxious , sipping water helps me feel more at ease.

In conclusion, my **water bottle** is something I truly can’t live without. While it may seem like a simple object, it has a significant impact on my daily life, and I would feel lost without it.

Describe a place you know where people can see a lot of wildlife

Today, I’d like to share about a place where people can experience nature and see a wide variety of wildlife, and that place is **Thảo Cầm Viên Park** . Located in District 1, right across from Independence Palace, Thảo Cầm Viên is one of the oldest and largest zoos in Vietnam. It’s known for its lush greenery, tranquil atmosphere, and diverse collection of animals.

When you visit Thảo Cầm Viên, you’ll find all sorts of creatures. There are majestic elephants, graceful giraffes, and striking big cats like tigers and lions. Bird lovers can also spot colorful species in the aviaries, and reptiles such as crocodiles and snakes have their own exhibits. Aside from the animals, Thảo Cầm Viên has beautiful botanical gardens, featuring exotic plants, towering old trees, and plenty of shaded paths for a relaxing stroll.

Many people come here to escape the hustle and bustle of the city and immerse themselves in a more natural setting. Families often plan weekend picnics, schools organize educational trips to teach students about wildlife, and tourists visit to learn about Vietnam’s rich biodiversity. Even though the zoo draws a lot of visitors, it feels spacious enough that you can still find peaceful corners to appreciate nature. Personally, I have fond memories of visiting Thảo Cầm Viên with my family. It was refreshing to be surrounded by greenery and observe the animals up close.

Overall, **Thảo Cầm Viên Park** offers a wonderful opportunity to reconnect with nature in the heart of Ho Chi Minh City. It’s not just about seeing the animals; it’s also a chance to learn about conservation efforts and the importance of preserving our environment for future generations.

**Describe a foreign country you would like to visit in the future**

One foreign country I would love to visit in the future is JapanFrom its ancient traditions to its modern innovations, Japan seems like a place full of unique experiences.

I have learned a lot about Japan through books, documentaries, and social media. It is famous for its stunning cherry blossoms, traditional temples, and delicious cuisine.  The main reason I want to visit Japan is that it offers a perfect balance between tradition and modernity.  Cities like Tokyo and Osaka are known for their  bustling streets, neon lights, and futuristic architecture , while places like Kyoto and Nara preserve the country’s history with their old shrines and peaceful gardens. Japan is also famous for its polite people, strong work ethic, and deep respect for customs. Moreover, I admire Japanese discipline and creativity, and I would love to see how these values shape daily life there.

Additionally, I have always been interested in Japanese pop culture, including anime, manga, and J-pop music.

Visiting Japan has been a dream of mine for years, and I hope I can turn it into reality soon. I believe this trip would be a once-in-a-lifetime experience, allowing me to learn more about a culture that I deeply respect and admire.

**Describe your mother’s job**

I’d like to talk about my mother, who works as an accountant at a secondary school. She has been doing this job for many years, and she is responsible for managing the school's finances, keeping records of expenses, and making sure everything is in order when it comes to the budget.

From what I know, her job requires a lot of accuracy and attention to detail. She handles financial reports, processes payments, and deals with school budgets. Sometimes she has to work with teachers and the school board to plan spending for various school activities. It can be quite stressful, especially during financial audits or at the end of the fiscal year, but she is very organized and always tries to stay calm under pressure.

This is her main job, but at home, she also takes care of our family. She cooks. Balancing her professional responsibilities and family duties is not easy, but she handles it all with care and love.

I feel very proud of my mother’s job. Being an accountant may not always be noticed by others, but it plays a key role in keeping the school running smoothly. She is hardworking and responsible, and she has taught me a lot about being disciplined and reliable. I really admire her and feel grateful to have her as my mother.

**Describe information search**

A few months ago, I searched for information to prepare for a seminar in my Applied Cryptography course at school. The main reason was to create a solid presentation on the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol. Specifically, I needed detailed insights into secure key exchange, authentication, and encrypting data to impress my professor and classmates.

I focused on finding technical documentation, particularly RFCs and whitepapers on cryptographic protocols. I also explored Stack Overflow and GitHub for code examples, which guided me to implement a lightweight demo app in C/C++. This app showcased how IKE handles key exchange, verifies authentication, and encrypts data in real-time.

The process was intense—I spent late nights cross-referencing resources and debugging my code. I enjoyed it immensely, though! Each breakthrough, like implementing a secure message app to work effectively, felt like a triumph, making the effort totally worthwhile for the seminar.
