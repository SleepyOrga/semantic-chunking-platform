Task 1

**Intro**

The chart illustrates how government in four countries invested in the transport infrastucture between 1990 and 2005.

**Overview (Trend and differences)**

Overall, **there was a decline** in the proportion of government spending on roads and transports in the UK, Portugal, Italy; meanwhile, a rise was seen in the USA. In addition, Portugal **gerenally** had the highest figures throughout the period.

- Gerenally: Khong hoan toan
- Consistently: Hoan toan

**Body 1**

The share of government’s budget spent on roads and transports in Portugal started at 27%, **after which** it saw a **progressive** decrease to **exactly** 20% in 2005 **. Conversely** , the figure for the USA rose from just over 10% in 1990 to 15% in 2005, despite a small fall in the first 5 years.

- Approximately = around = about = roughly
- Just over = north of = upward of
- Just under = shy of = downward of
- Exactly = precisely

**Body 2**

Around 22% of the Italian national budget was **went into (spend on)** transport infrastructure and a final decline from 24% in 2000 to about 19% in 2005. Similarity, **the figure for** the UK fluctuated in the range from 9% to 13% from 1990 to 2000, followed by ending the period at approximately 7%.

Task 1:

**Intro**

The line graph illustrates how much fishs and some other kinds of meat were consumed per person in a country in Europe from 1979 to 2004.

**Overview**

Overall, there was a decline in the amount of beef, lamb, and fish eaten, while the figure for chicken increased to surpass that of beef. Chicken was increasingly used and became the most from 1989 onwards.

**Body 1**

The amount of beef eaten per person in the country **examined** started at about 220 grams, after which it saw fluctuations until 1989, before decreasing to end the period at around 100grams. Conversely, the figure for chicken rose from just under 150 grams per person to north of 200 grams in 1989 and **kept rising to reach** 250 grams in the final year.

**Body 2**

Exactly 150 grams of lambs was used by an average person in the country mentioned in 1979, with a decline to approximately 75 gpp in 2004 **. Meanwhile** , the figure for fish decreased slightly from around 60 gpp to just under 50 gpp after a few years and maintained at this level towards the end of periods.

    - Ngoài việc sử dụng các cấu trúc so sánh nhất thông thường với the most/least/fewest, người học có thể sử dụng cấu trúc by far + so sánh nhất (the most/the highest number of…) để tăng mức độ nhấn mạnh trong câu.  Paper and packaging were manufactured     - by far the most     - among three provided products.
- Người học có thể sử dụng các từ vựng như “the majority”, “the minority” để chỉ đến phần đa số hay thiểu số.

Ví dụ: The minority of Japanese workers are employed in the agricultural sector.

- be recorded to be at the top of the list

Ví dụ: The proportion of the 15-25 age group was recorded to be at the top of the list.

- be the largest producer/consumer of ...

Ví dụ: Overall, Japan was the largest consumer of New Zealand’s kiwi fruit all time.

- be + the least/most favored/preferred

Ví dụ: Traveling by train was the least favored form of transportation.

- be + the most common/popular + N.

Ví dụ: Motorcycle is the most popular means of transport.

- The figure for X + be + X's number, (almost/more than) double/triple the figure for Y, at Y's number

Ví dụ: 350 million tonnes of paper and packaging had been produced, more than double 160 million tonnes of wood pulp and almost triple 130 million tonnes of sawn wood. (dùng tính từ twofold, threefold,double, triple, quadrupble,.., nếu double 160 millions thì là tăng gấp đôi 160 -&gt; sai)

- S + V + twice/three times/ four times/…+ as + much/many/adj/adv + (N) + as + N/pronoun.

There were twice as many children playing sports in 2009 as in 2005.

Twice as many children played sports in 2009 compared to 2005.

In 2010, the total value of New Zealand’s kiwi fruit in Japan was recorded at 271,1 million dollars, which was nearly 4 times as much as that in China.

- Tương tự như cấu trúc so sánh chung khi gặp khó khăn trong vấn đề xác định được độ chênh lệch giữa hai đối tượng, ngoài việc sử dụng các trạng từ đi kèm tính từ so sánh hơn, người học cũng có thể sử dụng các cấu trúc sau để cho thấy sự đối chiếu giữa các đối tượng:

X + be + tỉ lệ/con số + higher/lower than + Y

Ví dụ: The average figure for Country C was 10% higher than that of Country B, which was recorded at around 50% most of the time.

- Trong trường hợp các con số có độ chênh lệch quá lớn và người học không thể tính ra được tỉ lệ - độ chênh lệch đấy, người học vẫn có thể sử dụng cách so sánh một cách chung hơn bằng cách sử dụng cách diễn đạt Trạng từ + Tính từ so sánh hơn, chẳng hạn: “slightly/significantly/far higher/lower than”

Ví dụ:

The average price of a house in London was 20,000 pound, which was significantly / far higher than that of England, at around 13,000 pound.

The proportion of small businesses using social media accounted for about 28%, which is slightly lower than that of medium-sized ones.

X consumes slightly more beef than Y.

- Compared to/with/ In comparison with N

Ví dụ: Compared to/ with/in comparison with (prices in) Canada and Australia, prices in the UK are high.

- As compared to/ As opposed to

Ví dụ: Females accounted for over 90% of the teaching staff at Primary school as opposed to/compared to/in comparison with only 10% male counterparts.

...X's number, followed by Y's number of Y

Ví dụ: The highest amount of annual daytime on average is recorded for New York at 2535 hours per ear, followed closely by 2473 hours of Sydney.

- Bên cạnh đó, khi muốn diễn tả các xu hướng tương đồng/đối lập nhau, thay vì liệt kê thông tin của từng đối tượng và sử dụng các liên từ “Similarly” hay “By Contrast” như phần lý thuyết bên trên, người học có thể làm cho câu văn ngắn gọn hơn bằng cách sử dụng cách diễn đạt “a (quite) similar/opposite pattern is/was repeated for/seen in”.

a (quite) similar/opposite pattern is/was repeated for/seen in…

Ví dụ: Oil consumption in the USA increased slightly to reach its peak of 10 million barrels in 2015. A similar pattern was recorded for/seen in the number of barrels consumed in China and Middle East during the same period.

- Tương tự, cách diễn đạt “while the opposite is/was true for” cũng là một cách diễn đạt hay, đặc biệt có thể sử dụng trong phần Tổng quan (Overall) để có thể chỉ ra hai xu hướng - thông tin trái ngược nhau mà vẫn đảm bảo câu văn ngắn gọn, súc tích.

...while the opposite is/was true for…

Ví dụ:  Brazil, Vietnam and Indonesia experienced an upward trends in their coffee production, while the opposite was true for Colombia.

- Khi muốn chỉ ra một đối tượng có xu hướng đối lập/tương đồng, người học cũng có thể sử dụng cấu trúc “show a similar/different pattern”.

X + that show(s/ed) a similar/different pattern + be…

Ví dụ: The one country that showed a different pattern was Colombia.

- Khi muốn diễn tả hai đối tượng có số liệu tương đương nhau, người học cũng có thể sử dụng cách diễn đạt “share the same percentage/number of…”

X and Y share the same percentage/number of…

Ví dụ: Vietnam and China share the same percentage with 14 percent each.
