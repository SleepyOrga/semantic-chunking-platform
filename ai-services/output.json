Deep networks naturally integrate low/mid/highlevel features [49] and classifiers in an end-to-end multilayer fashion, and the \u201c levels \u201d of features can be enriched by the number of stacked layers (depth). Recent evidence [40, 43] reveals that network depth is of crucial importance, and the leading results [40, 43, 12, 16] on the challenging ImageNet dataset [35] all exploit \u201d very deep \u201d [40] models, with a depth of sixteen [40] to thirty [16] . Many other nontrivial visual recognition tasks [7, 11, 6, 32, 27] have also  \ngreatly benefited from very deep models.  \n![Figure](figures/page_6_page_001_figure_014.png)  \nFigure 1.

Similar phenomena on ImageNet is presented in Fig. 4 .  \nDriven by the significance of depth, a question arises: Is learning better networks as easy as stacking more layers? An obstacle to answering this question was the notorious problem of vanishing/exploding gradients [14, 1, 8] , which hamper convergence from the beginning. This problem, however, has been largely addressed by normalized initialization [23, 8, 36, 12] and intermediate normalization layers [16] , which enable networks with tens of layers to start converging for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with backpropagation [22] .  \nWhen deeper networks are able to start converging, a degradation problem has been exposed: with the network depth increasing, accuracy gets saturated (which might be unsurprising) and then degrades rapidly. Unexpectedly, such degradation is not caused by overfitting , and adding more layers to a suitably deep model leads to higher training error , as reported in [10, 41] and thoroughly verified by our experiments. Fig. 1 shows a typical example.  \nThe degradation (of training accuracy) indicates that no all systems are similarly easy to optimize. Let us consider a shallower architecture and its deeper counterpart that adds more layers onto it. There exists a solution by construction to the deeper model: the added layers are identity mapping, and the other layers are copied from the learned shallower model.

Instead of hoping each few stacked layers directly fit a desired underlying mapping, we explicitly let these layers fit a residual mapping. Formally, denoting the desired underlying mapping as $\\mathcal{H}(\\mathbf{x})$ , we let the stacked nonlinear layers fit another mapping of $\\mathcal{F}(\\mathbf{x}):=\\mathcal{H}(\\mathbf{x})-\\mathbf{x}$ . The original mapping is recast into $\\mathcal{F}(\\mathbf{x})+\\mathbf{x}$ . We hypothesize that it is easier to optimize the residual mapping than to optimize the original, unreferenced mapping. To the extreme, if an identity mapping were optimal, it would be easier to push the residual to zero than to fit an identity mapping by a stack of nonlinear layers.  \nThe formulation of $\\mathcal{F}(\\mathbf{x}) + \\mathbf{x}$ can be realized by feedforward neural networks with \u201c shortcut connections \u201d (Fig. 2 ). Shortcut connections [2, 33, 48] are those skipping one or more layers. In our case, the shortcut connections simply perform identity mapping, and their outputs are added to the outputs of the stacked layers (Fig. 2 ). Identity shortcut connections add neither extra parameter nor computational complexity. The entire network can still be trained end-to-end by SGD with backpropagation, and can be easily implemented using common libraries ( e.g. , Caffe [19] ) without modifying the solvers.  \nWe present comprehensive experiments on ImageNet [35] to show the degradation problem and evaluate our method. We show that: 1) Our extremely deep residual nets are easy to optimize, but the counterpart \u201c plain \u201d nets (that simply stack layers) exhibit higher training error when the depth increases; 2) Our deep residual nets can easily enjoy accuracy gains from greatly increased depth, producing results substantially better than previous networks.  \nSimilar phenomena are also shown on the CIFAR-10 set [20] , suggesting that the optimization difficulties and the effects of our method are not just akin to a particular dataset.

    "content": "We conducted more studies on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 50k training images and 10k testing images in 10 classes. We present experiments trained on the training set and evaluated on the test set. Our focus is on the behaviors of extremely deep networks, but not on pushing the state-of-the-art results, so we intentionally use simple architectures as follows. The plain/residual architectures follow the form in Fig. 3 (middle/right). The network inputs are 32x32 images, with the per-pixel mean subtracted. The first layer is 3x3 convolutions. Then we use a stack of 6n layers with 3x3 convolutions on the feature maps of sizes {32, 16, 8} respectively, with 2n layers for each feature map size. The numbers of filters are {16, 32, 64} respectively. The subsampling is performed by convolutions with a stride of 2. The network ends with a global average pooling, a 10-way fully-connected layer, and softmax. There are totally 6n + 2 stacked weighted layers. The following table summarizes the architecture: <table><tr><td>output map size</td><td>32x32</td><td>16x16</td><td>8x8</td></tr><tr><td># layers</td><td>1+2n</td><td>2n</td><td>2n</td></tr><tr><td># filters</td><td>16</td><td>32</td><td>64</td></tr></table> When shortcut connections are used, they are connected to the pairs of 3 x 3 layers (totally 3n shortcuts).

Classification error on the CIFAR-10 test set. All methods are with data augmentation. For ResNet-110, we run it 5 times and show 'best (mean \u00b1 std)' as in [42]. Our residual models have exactly the same depth, width, and number of parameters as the plain counterparts. We use a weight decay of 0.0001 and momentum of 0.9, and adopt the weight initialization in [12] and BN [16] but with no dropout. These models are trained with a minibatch size of 128 on two GPUs. We start with a learning rate of 0.1, divide it by 10 at 32k and 48k iterations, and terminate training at 64k iterations, which is determined on a 45k/5k train/val split. We follow the simple data augmentation in [24] for training: 4 pixels are padded on each side, and a 32 x 32 crop is randomly sampled from the padded image or its horizontal flip. For testing, we only evaluate the single view of the original 32 x 32 image. We compare n={3,5,7,9}, leading to 20, 32, 44, and 56-layer networks. Fig. 6 (left) shows the behaviors of the plain nets. The deep plain nets suffer from increased depth, and exhibit higher training error when going deeper. This phenomenon is similar to that on ImageNet (Fig. 4, left) and on MNIST (see [41]), suggesting that such an optimization difficulty is a fundamental problem. Fig. 6 (middle) shows the behaviors of ResNets. Also similar to the ImageNet cases (Fig. 4, right), our ResNets manage to overcome the optimization difficulty and demonstrate accuracy gains when the depth increases. We further explore n=18 that leads to a 110-layer ResNet. In this case, we find that the initial learning rate of 0.1 is slightly too large to start converging. So we use 0.01 to warm up the training until the training error is below 80% (about 400 iterations), and then go back to 0.1 and continue training. The rest of the learning schedule is as done previously. This 110-layer network converges well (Fig. 6, middle). It has fewer parameters than other deep and thin networks such as FitNet [34] and Highway [41] (Table 6), yet is among the state-of-the-art results (6.43%, Table 6). Analysis of Layer Responses. Fig. 7 shows the standard deviations (std) of the layer responses. The responses are the outputs of each 3 x 3 layer, after BN and before nonlinearity (ReLU/addition). For ResNets, this analysis reveals the response strength of the residual functions. Fig. 7 shows that ResNets have generally smaller responses than their plain counterparts. These results support our basic motivation (Sec. 3.1) that the residual functions might be generally closer to zero than the non-residual functions. We also notice that the deeper ResNet has smaller magnitudes of responses, as evidenced by the comparisons among ResNet-20, 56, and 110 in Fig. 7. When there are more layers, an individual layer of ResNets tends to modify the signal less. Exploring Over 1000 Layers. We explore an aggressively deep model of over 1000 layers. We set n=200 that leads to a 1202-layer network, which is trained as described above. Our method shows no optimization difficulty, and this 10^3 layer network is able to achieve training error < 0.1% (Fig. 6, right). Its test error is still fairly good (7.93%, Table 6). But there are still open problems on such aggressively deep models. The testing result of this 1202-layer network is worse than that of our 110-layer network, although both have similar training error. We argue that this is because of overfitting. The 1202-layer network may be unnecessarily large (19.4M) for this small dataset. Strong regularization such as maxout [9] or dropout [13] is applied to obtain the best results ([9, 25, 24, 34]) on this dataset. In this paper, we use no maxout/dropout and just simply impose regularization via deep and thin architectures by design, without distracting from the focus on the difficulties of optimization. But combining with stronger regularization may improve results, which we will study in the future. <table><tr><td>training data</td><td>07+12</td><td>07++12</td></tr><tr><td>test data</td><td>VOC 07 test</td><td>VOC 12 test</td></tr><tr><td>VGG-16</td><td>73.2</td><td>70.4</td></tr><tr><td>ResNet-101</td><td>76.4</td><td>73.8</td></tr></table> Table 7.

    "content": "We argue that this optimization difficulty is unlikely to be caused by vanishing gradients. These plain networks are trained with BN [16], which ensures forward propagated signals to have non-zero variances. We also verify that the backward propagated gradients exhibit healthy norms with BN. So neither forward nor backward signals vanish. In fact, the 34-layer plain net is still able to achieve competitive accuracy (Table 3), suggesting that the solver works to some extent. We conjecture that the deep plain nets may have exponentially low convergence rates, which impact the reducing of the training error. The reason for such optimization difficulties will be studied in the future. Next we evaluate 18-layer and 34-layer residual nets (ResNets). The baseline architectures are the same as the above plain nets, except that a shortcut connection is added to each pair of 3\u00d73 filters as in Fig. 3 (right). In the first comparison (Table 2 and Fig. 4 right), we use identity mapping for all shortcuts and zero-padding for increasing dimensions (option A). So they have no extra parameter compared to the plain counterparts.",
